---

## Public Calendar Feature (NEW - Phase 1 Enhancement)

**What is it?**
A read-only calendar view accessible by comités WITHOUT authentication, showing:
- Event dates
- Material types (flyer, banner, video, etc.)
- Request status (Pendiente, En_planificacion, En_diseño, Lista_para_entrega, Entregada)
- Priority scores (1-10 indicating urgency)

**Why?**
Strategic design decision to use software as a tool for organizational culture:
- **Transparency**: Comités understand the actual workload, not assumptions
- **Education**: Reduces conflicts by showing "we're not being slow, there's just a lot of work"
- **Empowerment**: Helps committees plan better by understanding existing requests

**What is NOT visible** (protected):
- Committee names (no identification of who requested)
- Event details (event name, description)
- Contact info (WhatsApp, encrypted)
- Bible verses (private)
- User names (private)

**Endpoints implemented**:
- `GET /api/public/calendar` - No auth required
- Query params: `month`, `year`, `materialType`, `status`
- Returns: List + status summary + material type summary

**Database support**:
- New view: `v_requests_public` (shows only safe fields)
- New RLS policy: "Public calendar access (no auth required)"
- Ready for Supabase SQL Editor

## ⏭️ NEXT PHASE: Phase 2 - Task Breakdown (10-20 min)

### Command to Execute

```bash
/speckit.tasks
```

This command will:
1. **Parse the 3 user stories** from spec.md
2. **Break them down into granular tasks** (10-20 tasks)
3. **Assign complexity** (story points or T-shirt sizes)
4. **Create a tasks.md file** with:
   - Detailed task descriptions
   - Dependencies between tasks
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Estimated time per task
5. **Organize by phases**:
   - Phase 2A: Database setup + scaffolding (Days 1-2)
   - Phase 2B: Core features (Days 3-8)
   - Phase 2C: Testing + deployment (Days 9-14)

### What Phase 2 Output Will Look Like

File: `specs/001-decom-system/tasks.md` (will be created)

```markdown
# Phase 2: Implementation Tasks - DECOM System

## Task Breakdown by Phase

### Phase 2A: Database & Scaffolding (Days 1-2)

#### Task 1: Set up Supabase project
- Subtasks:
  - Create Supabase account (if needed)
  - Create project in South America region
  - Copy credentials to .env.local
  - Run database-schema.sql in SQL Editor
  - Verify tables and indexes created
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - All 4 tables exist in Supabase dashboard
  - RLS policies enabled
  - Test data (5 committees) visible
- Estimated: 30 minutes
- Dependencies: None

#### Task 2: Set up Next.js project
- Subtasks:
  - npm install dependencies
  - Create Supabase client in lib/supabase/
  - Configure authentication
  - Set up environment variables
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - npm run dev starts without errors
  - Can login/signup flow works
  - Supabase client initialized
- Estimated: 1 hour
- Dependencies: Task 1

... [10-20 more tasks] ...
```

---

## After Phase 2 Planning is Done

Once `/speckit.tasks` completes, the workflow becomes:

1. **Assign tasks to team members**
   - Each task is independent and can be done in parallel
   - Tasks have dependencies marked (which must be done first)
   - Estimated time helps with planning

2. **Create sub-branches for each task**
   ```bash
   git checkout 001-decom-system
   git checkout -b 001-task/02-setup-supabase
   # Work on the task...
   # Commit and push
   git push origin 001-task/02-setup-supabase
   # Merge back to main feature branch when done
   ```

3. **Implement features in order**
   - Start with Phase 2A (database + scaffolding)
   - Then Phase 2B (core features)
   - Then Phase 2C (testing + deployment)

4. **Track progress** in the feature branch
   - Each task completion is a commit/PR
   - Update `tasks.md` as tasks are completed
   - Keep feature branch up to date

---

## Recommended Team Setup

If you have a team:

**Lead Developer** (or you if solo):
- Do Phase 2A (database setup)
- Create project structure
- Set up authentication

**Frontend Developer(s)**:
- Create UI components
- Implement forms
- Build dashboard screens

**Backend Developer**:
- Create API route handlers
- Implement business logic
- Connect to Supabase

**QA**:
- Write tests
- Test user flows
- Document edge cases

---

## Files Reference (Keep These Open)

1. **Specification**: `specs/001-decom-system/spec.md`
   - Read for feature requirements and acceptance criteria

2. **Database**: `specs/001-decom-system/contracts/database-schema.sql`
   - Copy-paste into Supabase to create tables

3. **API**: `specs/001-decom-system/contracts/api-contracts.md`
   - Reference for endpoint signatures

4. **Quickstart**: `specs/001-decom-system/quickstart.md`
   - Follow these 7 steps first

5. **Data Model**: `specs/001-decom-system/data-model.md`
   - Reference for validation rules

---

## Before You Execute /speckit.tasks

Make sure:

- ✅ You're on branch `001-decom-system`
- ✅ All planning documents are in `specs/001-decom-system/`
- ✅ Git is committed (no pending changes)
- ✅ You have about 10-20 minutes for the tasks breakdown

---

## 🚀 Ready to Begin Phase 2?

**If YES, run this command:**

```bash
cd /home/juanda/decom-system
/speckit.tasks
```

**What happens next:**
1. Script parses your feature specification
2. Generates detailed task breakdown
3. Creates `specs/001-decom-system/tasks.md`
4. Updates agent context
5. Gives you a ready-to-execute roadmap

---

## Alternative: Manual Task Creation

If `/speckit.tasks` has issues, you can manually create `specs/001-decom-system/tasks.md` based on this outline:

### Manual Task Template

```markdown
# Phase 2: Implementation Tasks

- Task 1.1: Create Supabase project (30 min)
- Task 1.2: Run database schema SQL (15 min)

... etc ...
```
